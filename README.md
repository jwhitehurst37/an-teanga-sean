# An Teanga Sean: The Celtic Languages

This is a project to explore the usage of Celtic languages like Welsh and Irish in the United Kingdom, as well as to provide some brief glimpse of when publications became prevalent in the Cornish Language Revival of the 20th century. This study utilizes census data from the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland to achieve the first goal, and a dataset created by the author during an internship at the University of South Florida Library Special Collections. With Tableau, Excel, and OpenRefine, the author aims to identify trends and provide some historical context for these trends.

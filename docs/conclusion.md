# Conclusion & Works Cited

### Concluding Thoughts

When conducting research, often every answer must be bought with one hundred more and new questions. This research proved no exception to that rule; where we saw a lack of urban engagement with Welsh language, could we demonstrate a disconnect with Welsh culture? Are the people of the mountains and coasts of Wales simply more *Welsh* than the city dwellers? Where we saw the Republic of Ireland bearing a language gap in the ‘millennial’ generation of people, could we infer a connection with digitization and globalization? On an internet that is largely monolingual, is it unsustainable to try and hold onto an old language like Irish, spoken by so few in the world? Will Celtic languages go the way of so many others and be casualties in the extinction-level disappearance of language in the world? And in the case of the Michael Krauss Collection on Cornish, how valuable can the digitization of these materials be? These questions are the best conclusion one could hope for; not an answer to end a project, but a prompt to begin many more.
